      <description>Setting up a self-hosted home server Why settle for something done poorly when you can do it better yourself? That&amp;rsquo;s the approach I took with creating a general, all-in-one media server / NAS. The main concern was relying on external, third-party software and services to conduct daily tech and media activities. The solution? Do it yourself. I&amp;rsquo;ve done exactly that, setting up a Raspberry Pi that I can tinker with and use daily, helping not only me but also my friends and family.</description>
