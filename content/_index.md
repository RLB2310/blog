# My Selfhosting and Hobby log

A simple webpage documenting my projects, ranging from selfhosting on my Raspberry Pi, to organising and customising my Linux systems.

Some examples of what I've documented :

- Configuring a Raspberry Pi 4 as a general media server and NAS for file sharing

- Efficiently managing dual operating systems on my personal desktop computer

- Using Linux for schoolwork and solving the Microsoft problem
