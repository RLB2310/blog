A simple webpage documenting my projects, ranging from selfhosting on my Raspberry Pi, to organising and customising my desktops and laptops.

Some examples of what I've documented :

- Configuring a Raspberry Pi 4 as a general media server and NAS for file sharing

- Efficiently managing dual operating systems on my personal desktop computer

- Using Linux for schoolwork and solving the 'Microsoft' problem

- Working with Docker and containerised programs

- Safely and effectively configuring the network (without port-forwarding)


The purpose of this webpage is to show the extra curricular work I complete and how I have learn't how to work with computer systems and networks.
