# Linux on laptops

Most laptops are either assumed to be used for Windows, if not, they most likely come with it pre-installed. This works for most people. It's simple, and skips the repetitive and painful process of the Windows install. But with Windows becoming more and more bloated by the update, with redundant AI features and random apps, old hardware is being left in the dust, and laptop batteries are draining faster than ever. So, I've decided to turn all my (2 whole laptops) into Linux machines, in an attempt to increase battery life and maybe get a few more hours out of them each day.

# The setup 

Majority of the configs and customisation was simply copied from my current PC install of Arch, however I did decided to use Sway instead of Hyprland, just for a little bit more of a lightweight alternative, in hopes to squeeze a bit more battery life from the laptop/s.
